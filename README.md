# exploring_the_evolution_of_linux
Find out about the development of the Linux operating system by exploring its Git repository history.

Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. In this project, I will read in, clean up and visualize a real world Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. With almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors (find out the exact number in this project ;-) ) there are some little data cleaning and wrangling challenges that we will encounter. But you'll also gain insights about the development activities over the last 13 years.
